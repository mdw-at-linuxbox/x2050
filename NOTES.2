timing in the 2050

In the 2050, there are a number of clock trains.  Some of them run all the
time, and some are gated and only run when various subsystems are active.

The two main cycles time-wise are the machine cycle, which is 512 ns
in length, and the main memory cycle, which is 2 microseconds (or 4
machine cycles).  The machine cycle clock is gated into 2 main streams,
the "cpu" clock, which only runs if the cpu is running, and the "io"
clock, active if I/O is enabled.

The cpu and main memory clocks are both divided into several sub-phases.
The main memory clock is based on the requirements of the core memory
used, and includes an R1, R2, WE, W2 phases.  Core memory reads are
inherently destructive, therefore, there is only one kind of memory cycle,
the read-modify-write cycle, and there is no "write enable" line going
to memory for write cycles.  Addresses must be supplied at the start of
R1, read data comes out at the end of R2, and write data goes in at WE.
The machine cycle is also divided up into sub-phases, due to the timing
considerations of local storage and ros.  Logic at the machine cycle
level is partially pipelined, and some operations of the previous cycle
complete after the next one starts in other parts.  So there
are references in the 2050 documentation to "late reg set", "latch pulse"
and so forth; these indicate sub-phases of the machine cycle.

In this verilog implementation, my goal is to make the machine
cycle the fundemental unit of time in the fpga.  That means
everything must be resolved as either combinational logic,
which resolves before a given time instant, or registered logic,
which will resolve before the next time increment.
